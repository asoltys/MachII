Mach-II is a framework for developing object oriented Model-View-Controller 
web-applications.  The framework focuses on easing software development and 
maintenance.  Mach-II was the first object-oriented framework for ColdFusion 
and continues to mature as a strong and viable framework choice for developers.

------------------------------------------------
1.	Download the core framework code from http://www.mach-ii.com.

2.	Unzip the framework to your web root. 

	a.	For example, on Windows the default web root is [DRIVE]:\Inetpub\wwwroot, 
		or if you are using ColdFusion's built-in web server, your web root is 
		likely [DRIVE]:\CFusionMX\wwwroot.  If you are on a Unix system, your web 
		root will vary.

	b.	The end result of this step is that you should have the directory MachII 
		(No hyphen) in your web root.  Inside this directory you will find the core 
		framework files.

	c.	If you wish to place the core Mach-II framework files in a location that is 
		different from your webroot, just create a mapping called "MachII" in the 
		ColdFusion Administrator that points this mapping to the location where you 
		placed the framework files.

3.	If you use sandbox security on your ColdFusion server, you may have to add the 
	framework's directory to your sandbox otherwise ColdFusion may throw an java 
	security exception.

Just three simple steps and you are done.  The Mach-II framework is just a ColdFusion 
application, so it will operate and behave just like any other ColdFusion application.
Please read the Upgrading Note below if you are upgrading your installation of Mach-II.

Mach-II uses absolute pathing for CFCs, so installation of both core framework files 
(the MachII directory).

If your webroot is "wwwroot", your directory structure should look like this:
|-+ wwwroot
  |- MachII
  |- MyCoolApplication
  |- MyBlogApplication

If you encounter problems:

1.	Please first ensure that your directory structure matches the one shown above
	or that your "MachII" mapping is pointing to the right directory if you are
	using a mapping.

2.	Clear your template cache if you have caching on and restart your ColdFusion 
	Application Server service.

3.	If problems persist, please check out the Mach-II for ColdFusion Google Group:
	http://groups.google.com/group/mach-ii-for-coldfusion

If you are updating your Mach-II installation from an older version, you must clear 
your template cache and restart your ColdFusion Application Server after you replace 
your older version with a newer version.

If you do not clear your template cache and restart your server, you will receive 
an error similar such as:

- The value returned from function getAppFactory() is not of type MachII.framework.AppFactory.
- Element AppLoader undefined in application[MACHII_APP_KEY].
